# Chatbot Project GDG Web Dev Workshop Day 2

This project implements a simple chatbot using the Gemini API. The chatbot is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** and provides a seamless interface for users to interact and receive responses powered by the Gemini API.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure and layout of the chatbot.
- `style.css`: The stylesheet used to style the chatbot interface.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the logic of interacting with the Gemini API and user inputs.

## Features

- **Chat Interface**: A user-friendly chat-container includes (header,chat-body,chat-footer) with send and receive messages.
- **Gemini API Integration**: Powered by Gemini API to provide intelligent responses to user queries.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with responsive design to ensure a seamless experience across devices.

## Demo

You can view the live version of the chatbot by opening the `index.html` file in your browser.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ghanasham2004/Web-Dev-Workshop.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Day-2 && cd Project
   ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to start using the chatbot.

## Setup and Installation

1. Ensure you have access to the **Gemini API** for chatbot responses. Youâ€™ll need an API key or credentials (depending on how Gemini API works).
2. Update the `script.js` file to include your Gemini API key and endpoint if necessary.
3. Customize the styling and add any features as per your needs.

## File Breakdown

- `index.html`: Contains the markup for the chatbot interface, including the text input field, message display area, and send button.
- `style.css`: Handles the visual appearance of the chatbot, including colors, spacing, and layout.
- `script.js`: Manages user interactions, handles the API calls to Gemini, and updates the chat interface dynamically based on the user input and API response.

## API Integration (Gemini API)

In `script.js`, the user input is sent to the Gemini API, which processes the query and sends a response back. The response is displayed in the chat window for the user to see.

Example:

```javascript
const response = await fetch(
  "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-flash-latest:generateContent?key=" +
    API_KEY,
  {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      contents: [
        {
          parts: [{ text: message }],
          role: "user",
        },
      ],
    }),
  }
);

const data = await response.json();
console.log(data);

// extract and clean the response
const apiResponse = data.candidates[0].content.parts[0].text.replace(
  /\*\*(.*?)\*\*/g,
  "$1"
);
// push response in messages array
messages.push({ sender: "bot", message: apiResponse });
// and render again all messages
renderMessages();
```

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the chatbot interface.
- **CSS**: For styling the chatbot.
- **JavaScript**: For adding dynamic functionality and API interaction.
- **Gemini API**: For processing user input and generating responses.
